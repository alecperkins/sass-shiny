{"name":"Sass-shiny","tagline":"","body":"# Shiny\r\n\r\n*(Some early thoughts, still rough, suggestions for improvement very welcome!)*\r\n\r\n*Shiny* is a style of writing [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), a preprocessor language for CSS. It looks at styles like [BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) and [SMACSS](http://smacss.com) and appreciates the concepts, but says “No thanks, there must be a smoother way”. (Takes some inspiration from [SUCKS](https://github.com/Team-Sass/SUCKS/blob/sam/thoughts.md).)\r\n\r\nShiny categorizes selectors, similar to SMACCS, and differentiates them with syntax, simliar to BEM. Unlike SMACSS and BEM, it takes more direct advantage of the `@extend` directive of Sass. This allows for avoiding chaining selectors as much as possible, or needing to combine the selectors into one long selector. Instead, presentational placeholders can be brought together under semantic classes. The `sass-shiny` package includes some helpers to do just that.\r\n\r\n## Spec\r\n\r\n    module              : Module\r\n    module component    : ModuleComponent\r\n    private module      : _Module\r\n    variant             : -variant\r\n    subvariant          : -variant_group--value\r\n    state               : [data-state=\"value\"]\r\n    built-in state      : :disabled\r\n    helper              : H-Helper\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Item` module contains components like `ItemCover` and `ItemTitle`. The `Item` module has variants like `-intrinsic_ratio` and `-size--half`. The `ItemCover` has variants like `-height--half` and `-height--twothirds`, among others. Variants MUST start with a `-`, and any class name that starts with a `-` MUST NOT be at root level. This guards against leaking variants, while avoiding the cumbersome, extra-long selectors of the BEM style. The modules, components, and variants are defined using placeholder classes. This way, they can be extended by semantic classes in the desired combinations. \r\n\r\nAnother way to think about it is all “things” are camelcase, presentational tweaks are hyphens and underscores, and states are `data-` attributes.\r\n\r\n### Module\r\n\r\nThe Module is the primary object. It SHOULD represent a reusable portion of an interface that serves as a single concept. It likely corresponds to a significant portion of the backend, or of front-end scripting as well.\r\n\r\nModule classes MUST be written using camelcase: `ModuleName`\r\nInternal modules and components, that are not intended to be extended by others, SHOULD be prefixed with an `_`, eg `%_ItemComponent`. \r\n\r\n### Component\r\n\r\nComponents are internal elements specific to a particular module. They MAY have subcomponents.\r\n\r\nComponent classes MUST be written using camelcase: `ModuleNameComponent`. These classes SHOULD be written prefixed with the name of the module they belong to. They SHOULD NOT be nested under the Module class unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n### Variant\r\n\r\nVariants are classes that adjust the presentation of the module. They MAY be exclusive to each other, or MAY be combined, depending on the rules they contain. Some variants are singular, like switching the variant on. Other variants are part of a group, and each “subvariant” is conceptually like setting a value to a property. Subvariants SHOULD be exclusive within their group.\r\n\r\nVariant class names\r\n\r\n* MUST begin with a hypen (`-`): `-variant`\r\n* MUST be nested under their corresponding Module: `&%-variant`\r\n* MAY use an underscore (`_`) to delimit words within the name: `-variant_group`\r\n\r\nSubvariants MUST use a double hypen (`--`) to separate the variant group name and the variant “value”: `-variant_group--value`.\r\n\r\n### State\r\n\r\nState selectors are used to specify presentation based on state. Some states, like `:hover` and `:disabled` are built-in, so those of course should be used. Other states, like `loading`, do not have a built-in pseudo selector. These states MUST be represented using `data-` attributes: `[data-loading=\"true\"]`. These attributes are easier to manipulate in script than `is-loading`, and this method allows for more specific information, like `[data-progress=\"40\"]`. Most importantly, using `data-` attributes clearly differentiates the state styles from the structural and other presentational styles.\r\n\r\n### Helper\r\n\r\nSometimes you just need a non-semantic class in the markup, like a wrapper for centering something. When this is the case, the class name SHOULD be prefixed with an `H-`. This indicates that the class is deliberately non-semantic.\r\n\r\n### Docs\r\n\r\nDocs are an important part of code. They explain the why, and when passed through a processor provide a good place to put example usage. This allows for automatic generation of artifacts like a styleguide. To that end, Shiny has a preferred style of writing docs, and includes a styleguide generator.\r\n\r\nThe primary definition of each module and component MUST be introduced with a comment section that describes what the module is, how it is used, and includes example markup. It also SHOULD include the variants for that module or component. The comments MUST be the inline style, even as a block, with each line beginning with `//`. (This is a limitation of the parsing more than anything. Hopefully this will be updated to allow for block comments of both styles.)\r\n[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax MUST be used for the comments.\r\nEach primary comment section MUST start with a heading and the module or component name (`# ModuleName module`), and SHOULD indicate if it is a module or component. Example markup MUST be added using backticks, and SHOULD indicate that it is HTML, using the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) method.\r\n\r\nFor example, a primary comment for a component that includes variants and\r\nexample markup:\r\n\r\n    // # ItemCover component\r\n    //\r\n    // An optional component of the Item module that displays a cover image. It\r\n    // uses the `style=\"\"` attribute and the `background-image: url()` rule\r\n    // instead of an `img` in order to control the aspect ratio.\r\n    //\r\n    // The cover MAY contain other components, like ItemSupertitle and ItemTitle,\r\n    // even ItemDeck, grouped in an ItemInfo component. The ItemInfo allows for\r\n    // positioning the interior components as a group.\r\n    //\r\n    // ```html\r\n    // <div class=\"Item\">\r\n    //     <div class=\"ItemCover -height--half\" style=\"background-image: url(http://placepuppy.it/800/600/)\">\r\n    //         <div class=\"ItemInfo\">\r\n    //             <div class=\"ItemSupertitle\">Supertitle</div>\r\n    //             <h2 class=\"ItemTitle\">Title</h2>\r\n    //         </div>\r\n    //     </div>\r\n    // </div>\r\n    // ```\r\n    //\r\n    // ## Variants\r\n    //\r\n    // ### `-height--*`\r\n    //\r\n    // The actual height of the cover is dependent on the size of the Item it is\r\n    // inside. It can be controlled with the `-height--half` and\r\n    // `-height--twothirds` variants, which set the cover to half or twothirds of\r\n    // its usual height.\r\n    //\r\n    // The parent Item MAY have a variant like `-intrinsic_ratio`, which causes\r\n    // the ItemCover to instead scale with a consistent aspect ratio. This variant\r\n    // is on the item since it requires an additional wrapper around the cover,\r\n    // the ItemCoverWrapper component. If this is active, then the `-height--*`\r\n    // variants don’t make much sense and SHOULD NOT be used.\r\n    //\r\n    // #### `-height--half`\r\n    //\r\n    // ```html\r\n    // <div class=\"Item -size--small\">\r\n    //     <div class=\"ItemCover -height--half\" style=\"background-image: url(http://placepuppy.it/800/600/)\">\r\n    //         <div class=\"ItemInfo\">\r\n    //             <div class=\"ItemSupertitle\">Supertitle</div>\r\n    //             <h2 class=\"ItemTitle\">Title</h2>\r\n    //         </div>\r\n    //     </div>\r\n    // </div>\r\n    // ```\r\n    %ItemCover\r\n    <the actual component code>\r\n\r\nThe example markup will be turned into live examples, as well as viewable source. The actual source of the module or component will also be included in an expandable section. All headings will be given deep links using anchors based on their content.\r\n\r\nThe generator makes some assumptions about the structure of the docs. If the styleguide output seems weird, the code probably is, too. The code itself SHOULD also have inline comments as appropriate. These will be passed through and included in the styleguide.\r\n\r\n## On the naming\r\n\r\nThe names “module” and “component” are chosen over “block” and “element”, since those have other meanings in this context (display: block, content block, HTML element). “Module” and “component” also correlate with the same JavaScript concepts. “Variant” was chosen over “modifier” since that’s a little too close to “module”. Why CamelCase? It helps to differentiate, and establish that this thing is a *thing*. Also, it stands out in normal text without additional formatting, making the modules and components easier to write about—important for documentation. An added bonus, the modules can easily correspond to related JavaScript/CoffeeScript class names. There is not a distinction between module and component names, aside from the [Smurf prefixing](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/new-programming-jargon.html), because the differences are potentially fuzzy. Having all “things” be named in that style keeps it simpler.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nGiven the module definitions:\r\n\r\n```sass\r\n%Item\r\n    width: 100%\r\n    &%-size--fourth\r\n        width: 25%\r\n    &%-size--third\r\n        width: 33.33333%\r\n    &%-size--half\r\n        width: 50%\r\n\r\n%ItemCover\r\n    background-size: cover\r\n\r\n%Container\r\n    max-width: 1280px\r\n    margin: 0 auto\r\n    &%-full\r\n        max-width: none\r\n    &%-spaceless\r\n        font-size: 0\r\n        > *\r\n            font-size: 1rem\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe presentational variants can be combined into nice, clean semantic classes:\r\n\r\n```sass\r\n.Story\r\n    @extend %Item\r\n    @extend %Item%-size--small\r\n    .IssueContents &\r\n        @extend %Item%-size--half\r\n    &.-featured\r\n        @extend %Item%-size--full\r\n.StoryCover\r\n    @extend %ItemCover\r\n.Issue\r\n    @extend %Container\r\n    @extend %Container%-full\r\n.IssueContents\r\n    @extend %Container\r\n    @extend %Container%-full\r\n    @extend %Container%-spaceless\r\n```\r\n\r\nCorresponding to this markup:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"Issue\">\r\n    <a class=\"IssueTitle\">Issue Two</a>\r\n    <ul class=\"IssueContents\">\r\n        <li class=\"Story -featured\">\r\n            <div class=\"StoryCover\"></div>\r\n            <a class=\"StoryTitle\">Story One</a>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li class=\"Story\">\r\n            <div class=\"StoryCover\"></div>\r\n            <a class=\"StoryTitle\">Story Two</a>\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe markup using the direct presentational selectors would look like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"Container -full\">\r\n    <a>Issue Two</a>\r\n    <ul class=\"Container -spaceless -full\">\r\n        <li class=\"Item -size--full\">\r\n            <div class=\"ItemCover\"></div>\r\n            <a class=\"ItemTitle\">Story One</a>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li class=\"Item -size--half\">\r\n            <div class=\"ItemCover\"></div>\r\n            <a class=\"ItemTitle\">Story Two</a>\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot terrible, but certainly less semantic. The variants can of course be extended into a single long selector, if desired for performance reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Module spec helpers\r\nUsing the placeholders does get a bit repetitive. Shiny includes helpers. The `+extends` mixin takes a module name and any variants. For subvariants, separate the variant group and the variant value with a space.\r\n\r\nSo these extends:\r\n```sass\r\n.IssueContents\r\n    @extend %Container\r\n    @extend %Container%-full\r\n    @extend %Container%-spaceless\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecome:\r\n```sass\r\n.IssueContents\r\n    +extends(Container, full, spaceless)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSubvariants work like this:\r\n```sass\r\n.Story\r\n    +extends(Item, size half)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
